# Flight Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting flight prices based on various features such as departure time, arrival time, airline, and duration. The goal of the project is to help users find the best price for a flight based on historical data.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates the price of a flight ticket using features extracted from flight details. It leverages techniques such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning to achieve optimal performance.
